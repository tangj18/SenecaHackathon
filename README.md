# Seneca Hackathon Digital Passport Front End by Jamie Tang
You can find the front end for this application [here](https://github.com/raymondchuu/seneca-hackathon-digital-passport-backend). This contains the code for our front end digital health card mobile app coded in React Native. 

## The Problem
We were tasked to develop a solution to a digital health card that tracks for previous covid tests/vaccinations and contact tracing. This repository provides the solution for the front end portion of the app that allows users of all technology level to use. We had to implement a user interface that was simple to use, but to make it also look visually appealing.

## Implementation
We decided to code our front end mobile app on React Native for many reason. The first reason being that most of our developers were already familiar with the web framework ReactJS and the other reason being that React Native is compatible for both IOS and Android. 

## Challenges
The biggest challenge was time itself. It was very difficult to learn all these new technologies, to let alone try to actually build an application from scratch. We understood that the challenge was more to think of a solution, but it's always great to have a working example.
